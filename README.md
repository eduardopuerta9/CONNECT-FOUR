### ***Getting Started***
##### On a board that is 7x6 two players go against each other until someone connects four of their items. This can be done vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. To begin the game click on the row that you want your item into. When there is a winner a message will be displayed, in case of draw just click on the restart button to start all over.
